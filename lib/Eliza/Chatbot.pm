=head1 NAME

Eliza::Chatbot - Eliza chatbot

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.03

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Eliza::Chatbot

    my $bot = Eliza::Chatbot->new();
    
    $bot->command_interface;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements the classic Eliza algorithm. The original Eliza program was 
written by Joseph Weizenbaum and described in the Communications of the ACM in 1966.  
Eliza is a mock Rogerian psychotherapist.  It prompts for user input, and uses a simple 
transformation algorithm to change user input into a follow-up question.  The program 
is designed to give the appearance of understanding.

=head1 OPTIONS

    my $bot = Eliza::Chatbot->new(name => 'WoW');

You can pass the following options into the Chatbot

=over 

=item name 

Rename Eliza

=item script_file

Pass in your own script file

=item debug

Turn debug mode on - 1.

=item prompts_on

Turn prompts on - 1.

=item memory_on

Turn memory off - 0.

=back

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 command_interface

    $chatterbot->command_interface;

command_interface() opens an interactive session with the Eliza object, 
just like the original Eliza program. 

During an interactive session invoked using command_interface(),
you can enter the word "debug" to toggle debug mode on and off.
You can also enter the keyword "memory" to invoke the _debug_memory()
method and print out the contents of the Eliza instance's memory.

This module is written in Moo which means it should be relatively easy
for you to design your own session format. All you need to do is extend 
L<Eliza::Chatbot> and maybe L<Eliza::Chatbot::Brain> if you're feeling ambitious.
Then you can write your own while loop and your own methods.

=head2 instance

    $chatterbot->instace;

Return a single instance of the Eliza Object
